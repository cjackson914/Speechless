                            <h3>Marilyn Monroe</h3>
                            <p>From “The Seven Year Itch” to “Some Like it Hot,” Monroe’s breathy voice was as much a star as she was.
                                But it didn’t always roll off her tongue quite so easily. She stuttered from an early age, and a speech
                                therapist suggested that she adopt the throaty tone to overcome her disability. That voice became her
                                trademark, but she never fully stopped stuttering.</p>
                
                                <p>“It was terrible,” she once said of it. “I don’t know how it happened. I just stuttered.”</p>
                
                                <p>In 1955 she recalled, “I guess you might say I gave up talking for a long while. I used to be so
                                embarrassed in school. I thought I’d die whenever a teacher called upon me. I always had the feeling of
                                not wanting to open my mouth, that anything I said would be wrong or stupid.”</p>
                
                                <p>It followed her throughout her career, even inciting the wrath of a director on at least one occasion
                                when she stuttered a line-reading.</p>
                
                                <p>“The director was furious. He said, ‘You don’t stutter,’ ” she recalled. “I said, ‘That’s what you
                                think!’ ”</p>
                
                                <p>“Oh, it’s painful,” she added. “Oh, God.”</p>

                            <h3>Joe Biden</h3>
                            <p>As a current presidential candidate and former Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden is required to speak in public at high-profile events more often than most. It’s no secret that Vice President Biden has struggled with a stutter throughout his life, but it makes it all the more impressive and inspiring that he has risen to the second-highest office you can possibly hold in the United States. </p>
                
                                <p>““I never had professional therapy, but a couple of nuns taught me to put a cadence to my speaking, and that’s why I spent so much time reading poetry,” Biden wrote.</p>
                
                                <p>But even in my small, boys’ prep school, I got nailed in Latin class with the nickname Joe Impedimenta. You get so desperate, you’re so embarrassed.”</p>
                
                                <p>Overcoming the disability, and the outcast status it gave him, made him that much stronger and more empathetic later in life, he noted.</p>
                
                                <p>“If I could share one piece of advice with all of those struggling with a stutter, it would be this: When you commit yourself to a goal and when you persevere in the face of struggle, you will discover new strengths and skills to help you overcome not only this challenge, but future life challenges as well. I promise you – you have nothing to be ashamed of, and you have every reason to be proud.”</p>

                            <h3>James Earl Jones</h3>
                            <p>“The Great White Hope” actor became one of Hollywood’s most famous voices, lending it to “The Lion King,” “Star Wars” and CNN. But Jones stuttered so badly that he spent eight years of his childhood barely speaking to anyone — except his family and the animals on the Mississippi farm where he lived.</p>
                
                                <p>“Stuttering is painful. In Sunday school, I’d try to read my lessons, and the children behind me were falling on the floor with laughter,” Jones told the Daily Mail in 2010. “My stuttering was so bad that I gave up trying to speak properly.”</p>
                
                                <p>But he loved words, specifically the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe. One of his high school English teachers noticed that and had Jones read poetry in front of the class, forcing him to work on his stutter. He eventually learned to keep it at bay enough to make a living with his voice — though it never went away entirely.</p>
                
                                <p>“I don’t say I was ‘cured,’ ” he told NPR. “I just work with it.”</p>
                
                                <p>Jones’ story inspired so many that in 1987 he became the first recipient of the Annie Glenn Award, which honors those who positively affect people suffering from communication disorders.</p>
