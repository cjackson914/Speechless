            <h3>Marilyn Monroe</h3>
            <p>From “The Seven Year Itch” to “Some Like it Hot,” Monroe’s breathy voice was as much a star as she was.
                But it didn’t always roll off her tongue quite so easily. She stuttered from an early age, and a speech
                therapist suggested that she adopt the throaty tone to overcome her disability. That voice became her
                trademark, but she never fully stopped stuttering.</p>

                <p>“It was terrible,” she once said of it. “I don’t know how it happened. I just stuttered.”</p>

                <p>In 1955 she recalled, “I guess you might say I gave up talking for a long while. I used to be so
                embarrassed in school. I thought I’d die whenever a teacher called upon me. I always had the feeling of
                not wanting to open my mouth, that anything I said would be wrong or stupid.”</p>

                <p>It followed her throughout her career, even inciting the wrath of a director on at least one occasion
                when she stuttered a line-reading.</p>

                <p>“The director was furious. He said, ‘You don’t stutter,’ ” she recalled. “I said, ‘That’s what you
                think!’ ”</p>

                <p>“Oh, it’s painful,” she added. “Oh, God.”</p>
